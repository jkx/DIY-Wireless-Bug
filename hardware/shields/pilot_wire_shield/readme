# Board description

This shield is designed to provide electric heater control through "pilot wire"
interface. It uses 2 MOC to control positive and negative part of the input
sinusoid. It also uses a shift register to store values without need of the AVR.
This shield is designed to go BELOW the bugOne main board. It would otherwise 
hide the antenna and leds.
