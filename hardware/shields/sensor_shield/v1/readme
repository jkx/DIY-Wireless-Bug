# Board description

This shield is designed to provide different possibilities to create a sensor
shield, for relative humidity and temperature. All choices do not need to be
soldered. A 8P8C (RJ45) modular connector is provided in order to export the sensors
further from the board (to avoid sensor noise). A repeater board is also
provided (in the corresponding subdirectory), in order to connect the sensors
through RJ45 wire.

# BOM

The following components can be soldered on the board:
	- Sensirion SHT21/SHT25 (U1): cheap (~4$) QFP sensor, using I2C for communication
		http://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/Humidity/Sensirion_Humidity_SHT21_Datasheet_V4.pdf
		Resolution and precision are interesting, and it is low power (less than 1uA when asleep, 1mA when measuring temp, 330uA when measuring RH). However, it is difficult to solder...
	- HH10D (U2): this is a humidity sensor provided by HopeRF. It is quite expensive but efficient. 
		http://www.hoperf.com/upload/sensor/hh10d.pdf
	- DHT11 (U3): cheap but unprecise RH and temp sensor. It is widely used.

	- DS18B20 (U4): popular 1-Wire temperature sensor from Maxim.

2 pull-up resistors can be soldered. 
	R1 is the pull-up resistor for DHT11. Expected value is 5kOhm if the sensor is connected through a wire shorter than 20m. 
	R2 is the pull-up resistor for 1-Wire bus. Expected value is 4.7kOhm.
	R3 and R4 are the pull-up resistors for I2C bus. Values can range from 1.8 to 10k. I prefer using 1.8k (strong pull-up), but the higher the resistance, the lower the current consumption.

# Pinout

RJ45 pinout:

P1: 1-Wire bus, PB1
P2: Vcc
P3: SDA, PC4
P4: SCL, PC5
P5: FOUT pin if HH10D connected (unusable if HH10D on the shield), PD5
P6: DATA1 pin if DHT11 connected (unusable if DHT11 on the shield), PD3
P7: PC2 (ADC pin, usable for light sensor for example)
P8: GND

Shield pinout : 

CONN1_2 : FOUT, PD5
CONN1-5 : 1-Wire bus, PB1
CONN2_3 : DHT11 DATA1, PD3
CONN2_4 : SCL, PC5
CONN2_5 : SDA, PC4
CONN2_6 : battery sense, PC3
CONN2_7 : external connector, PC2
