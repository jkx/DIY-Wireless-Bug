# Board description

This shield is designed to provide different possibilities to create a sensor
shield, for relative humidity, temperature, pressure and lux. All choices do not need to be
soldered. 

The following components can be soldered on the board:
	- Sensirion SHT31D (U1): cheap (~5$ at Farnell) QFP sensor, using I2C for communication
	https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/Humidity_Sensors/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Datasheet_digital.pdf
	- Bosch BME280 (U2) : temperature, humidity and pressure. The package seems more protected than the Sensirion (and we had troubles with the Sensirion which seems to age fast).

	- Rohm BH1750 (U3) : Light sensor (Luxmeter)

	- DS18B20 (U4): popular 1-Wire temperature sensor from Maxim.

C1 stabilizes the power line. Expected value is 100nF.
R1 is the pull-up resistor for 1-Wire bus. Expected value is 4.7kOhm.
R2 and R3 are the pull-up resistors for I2C bus. Values can range from 1.8 to 10k. I prefer using 1.8k (strong pull-up), but the higher the resistance, the lower the current consumption. We use 4.7k on the board
R4 is the pull up resistor for the BH1750 sensor. Along with C2, it provides correct timing for the reset. Ideal values are 1k for R4 and 100n for C1
R5 and R6 are a voltage divider for battery sensing. It divides voltage by 2, allowing a battery up to 6.6V. 
R7 is there to limit current in the ADDR tri state buffer from the BH1750. Expected value is 100k.

U1, U2 and U3 uses I2C.
