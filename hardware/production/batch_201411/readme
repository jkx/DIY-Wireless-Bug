Production files for November 2014 batch

The aim is to get the following boards : 
	- 70 bugOne_mini
	- 25+ sensor shields
	- 5+ sht21 breakout
	- 35 battery power shields
	- optionnally, 5+ repeater

This has been done in 3 different boards (10x10cm). A .8mm cut line is used, the
cutter can only cut through a whole board, which limits sorting possibilities.
