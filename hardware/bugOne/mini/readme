# Board description

This is a miniaturized version of bugOne board. Power connectors have been
rotated in order to reduce the board length below 50 mm. Shields stay compatible
in size. 

# Noticeable changes

	* A PMOS has been introduced, to provide a shutdown feature on selected
	  devices. RF transmitter can now be completely powered off, by setting pin
	  PB7 as input (a pull up is used), and powerd on by setting it to 0. This
	  controlled power line is accessible as V+ on CONN2.
	* Power connectors have been modified
	* A new LDO regulator is used, either MCP1700 or XC6206 (preferred choice).
	  They aure pin compatible. 
	* Grounded mounting holes are provided. One of them is located near the
	  antenna output, providing an easy way to ground an external antenna.
	* R0 is not used as a fuse anymore, but as a bypass in case no regulator is
	  soldered. The same mechanism is provided by the shield, in order to keep
     the same pinout as before on the shield connectors.
	* ISP connector is now usable even with a shield connected (same line as the
	  antenna)
