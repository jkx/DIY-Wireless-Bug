# Board description

This board is a small battery supply card. It uses a Microchip MCP1640 boost
converter, and is usable with a single 1.5V battery. It is designed to provide a
3.3V (or 5v, depending on the resistor) output on Vcc. 

Please note that this is a very basic board : it does not make use of advanced
features such as Vin to Vout connection and enables.
